The AudioKit organization has created and maintains many repositories. It's important to us that our work is tested and proved to build successfully across as many platforms as possible using Github's "Actions" continuous integration system.

Repositories and visualization repos depend on AudioKit as the core:

But we're also creating projects that can be used independently from AudioKit itself:
